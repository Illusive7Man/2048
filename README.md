# 2048
AI player of the game "2048"


GameManager_3.py should be run without arguments in console for it to run. It will automatically display bot's moves along with the computer moves (random 2s and 4s). 
It uses alpha beta pruning with iterative deepening. 
Main requirement was for it to come up with a move in less than 0.1 seconds.
It was averaging around 1024 when I was testing it. 

All files besides PlayerAI_3.py were available beforehand.
